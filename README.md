## Project Description
- The final project for my C++ course.
- Simulated a UNO game that has 4 players (either real player and/or bot), by completing the missing parts of source files provided by the course instructor.
- Using OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism to implement different elements in a UNO game.
- Usage of vectors and pointers is also included.

## Note
- unogame.cpp is the game client program.
- We are required to complete missing parts from 10 of 28 source files, where 2 of them are header files, and 8 of the are cpp files.
